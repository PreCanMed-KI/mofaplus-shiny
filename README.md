# Interactive MOFA+

MOFA+ models made interactive with Shiny by RStudio.

See [more on MOFA+ here](https://github.com/biofam/MOFA2/). See [more on Shiny apps here](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/).

## Getting started

To run the app, you can clone the repository and start the Shiny app directly from the terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/gtca/mofaplus-shiny
R -e "shiny::runApp('mofaplus-shiny/app')"
```
